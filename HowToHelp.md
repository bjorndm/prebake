You can help by
  * using prebake in your project and giving feedback via the [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/prebake/issues/list) or at the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/prebake-discuss).
  * write tool wrappers for your favorite tools.  We need wrappers for widely used tools like `gcc` and for obscure ones.   See [HowToWriteAToolFile](HowToWriteAToolFile.md)
  * continuous integration integration.  Change continuous integration systems so they can kick off builds using prebake.
  * IDE integration.  And yes, emacs is an IDE, not just an Operating System :)
