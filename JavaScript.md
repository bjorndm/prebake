For this project, JavaScript refers to [EcmaScript 5th edition](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm).  It will run JavaScript on a [beta version](http://code.google.com/p/prebake/source/browse/trunk/code/third_party/rhino) of [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/) that supports 5th edition features such as Object freezing until such time as a full 5th edition interpreter is available.
