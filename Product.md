# Product <font size='1'><a href='http://code.google.com/p/prebake/source/browse/trunk/code/src/org/prebake/service/plans/Product.java'>(src)</a></font> #

A plan file declares zero or more products which are [Î›SON](YSON.md) structures of the form:
```
{
  "name": "...",                                              // required
  "inputs": [                                                 // required
    "example/**/*.java"
  ],
  "outputs": [                                                // required
    "example/**/*.class"
  ],
  "actions": [                                                // required
    ...
  ],
  "help": "Documentation for this product",                   // optional
  "intermediate": true                                        // optional
}
```

## Name ##
A string that uniquely identifies this product.
The name must not be empty and can only contain JavaScript name characters
(alphanumerics, '_', '$'), dots and dashes; but cannot be all dots._

A good naming convention is dot separated identifiers.

## Inputs ##
[Globs](Glob.md) that specify which files the actions apply to.

## Outputs ##
[Globs](Glob.md) that specify which files are generated by the actions.

## [Actions](BuildAction.md) ##
A series of actions that will derive the outputs from the inputs.

## Help ##
It may be a string or a [DocumentationRecord](DocumentationRecord.md).
If a string, the help text is treated as PreformattedStaticHtml format.

Human readable documentation that explain some or all of:
  * why the product exists
  * the type of inputs
  * the type of outputs
  * why outputs need to be built
  * relationship to other products
  * which non-intermediate product to build if this is intermediate
  * trouble-shooting steps if this product fails to build

## Contact ##
Email address of the maintainer of this product who can answer questions.

## Intermediate ##
True if this product is needed so that other products can be built, but should not be specified as a target to the `build` [command](PreBakeCommand.md).
