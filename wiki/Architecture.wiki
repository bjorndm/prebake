== Usage ==

{{{
prebakery --root=<client-root-directory> --ignore <ignore-pattern> [--umask=<umash>]
}}}

will start up the bakery service.  It will write out {{{.prebakery.pid}}} in <client-root-directory> if there is none already running.

The <client-root-directory> is a directory containing all source files manipulable by the system.

The <ignore-pattern> is a regex of file paths to ignore, such as {{{.*~|.*bak}}}.
