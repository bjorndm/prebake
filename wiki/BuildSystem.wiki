#summary Mathy definition of a build system.

= What is a Build System? =

A build system permutes a file system to build output files from a set of source files.
The build system uses a set of rules to produce the output files.

The set of rules specify a transformation from an input file system to an output file system.

  BuildSystem : file-system → file-system'

Build systems typically allow a developer to build portions of file-system' so they can produce an executable for one architecture but not another.  So there exists a conceptual file-system describing all possible outputs : file-system*.

A build system is *consistent* when the developer's real file-system contains all the source files (file-system) and a subset of the files in the conceptual file-system*.

  isConsistent(file-system') == (file-system' ⊃ file-system) && (file-system' ⊂ file-system*)

So the source file-system is trivially consistent.

Many common build systems have no way to know whether they are consistent ; if you build some output files, change a source file, and rebuild you might get a different result than if you had not done the first build.
