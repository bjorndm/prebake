If not provided, it is inferred from the details using the same scheme that [http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/ javadoc] uses to find the first sentence:

        This sentence ends at the first period that is followed by a blank,
        tab, or line terminator, or at the first tag (as defined below).
        For example, this first sentence ends at "Prof.":

        This is a simulation of Prof. Knuth's MIX computer.
