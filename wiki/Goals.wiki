= Goals =
  # Hermetic -- the output of a build should not depend on [SourceFile source files] not specified as inputs
  # Reliable -- a [GeneratedFile generated file] should be scheduled for rebuilding if any file it depends on has changed or if the rules that specify how it is built have changed
  # Efficient -- files should be rebuilt unnecessary, and files shouldn't be examined unnecessarily
  # Complete -- it should be able to build files from any language for which [ExtTool tools] with a command line interface are available
  # Succinct -- common and easy tasks should be specifiable with little code
  # Flexible -- it should be possible to specify complex tasks, such as learning optimization flags
  # Widely Usable -- it should not requiring learning an obscure language or understanding specialized theory
  # Dynamically Extensible -- user code should be able to integrate home grown tools without breaking out into a different language
  # Inspectable -- it should expose useful statistics and derivative data to continuous integration tools
  # Automatable -- it should be drivable by continuous integration tools
