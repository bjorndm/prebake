#summary ignored files

The ignore [Usage flag] passed to the PreBakery causes it to overlook certain files.  Paths that match the ignore regular expression.

The regular expression is specified in [http://java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html Java's variant of Perl 5 syntax].

== Example ==
The ignore pattern
{{{
\.pyc$|~$|/\.svn/|\.rej$|\.r\d+$
}}}
will ignore compiled python files generated from python source files, temporary files left by emacs, subversion's internal book-keeping files, and merge conflict files left by patch.

== Affects ==
The ignore pattern affects several parts of the system.
  # ignored files will not be copied to the TmpWorkspace so cannot be [SourceFile]s and will not be visible to [BuildAction]s
  # ignored files will not be copied back from the TmpWorkspace so cannot be [GeneratedFile]s.

Ignored files can be explicit inputs to the system, so can be
  # [PlanFile]s
  # [ToolFile]s
  # {{{load}}}ed by the above

== OS Independent ==
The ignored files will match against paths normalized to use POSIX style file separators so {{{/}}} can be used as the file systems even on Windows systems.

== The default ignore pattern ==
If the ignore pattern is not specified, it is the union of the below.

|| *Regexp* || *Reason* ||
|| `\.pyc$` || generated python ||
|| `~$` || emacs backup ||
|| `\.bak$` || other backup files ||
|| `/#[^/]+#$` || emacs unsaved ||
|| `/%[^/]*%$` || more backup files  ||
|| `/\.(#+|_+)$` || temporary files ||
|| `\.rej$` || {{{patch}}} reject file ||
|| `\.prej$` || more reject files ||
|| `\.tmp$` || common temp file suffix ||
|| `/(CVS|SCCS|\.svn)(/|$)` || revision control bookkeeping files ||
|| `/\.cvsignore$` || CVS metadata ||
|| `/vssver.scc$` || more revision control metadata ||
|| `/\.DS_Store$` || Macintosh droppings ||
