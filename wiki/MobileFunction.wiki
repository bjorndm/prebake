#summary A JavaScript function with no free variables besides intrinsics.

= Mobile Functions =

A JavaScript functions that can be moved from one JavaScript interpreter
to another without changing meaning.

A mobile function has no [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_variables_and_bound_variables free variables] besides commonly defined globals that are available in all contexts : `Object`, `Function`, `Date`, `Math`, etc.  See [CommonJsEnv the common JavaScript defs] and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/prebake/source/browse/trunk/src/org/prebake/js/YSON.java">the source</a> for the full list.

For example, `function (x, y) { return x + y; }` is mobile because it has no free variables ; `x` and `y` are both parameters.

And `function (x) { return String(s); }` is mobile as well.  Even though it has a free variable {{{String}}}, that variable's behavior is specified by the language, so that function can be moved from one context to another without changing its meaning.

But `function (x, y) { foo(x + 1); }` is not mobile, because its meaning depends on the free variable `foo`.
