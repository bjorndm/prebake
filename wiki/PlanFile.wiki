#summary a JavaScript file that defines products.

= Plan Files =

A plan file specifies how to build outputs.  See one of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/prebake/source/browse/trunk/code/Bakefile.js">prebake's plan file</a> for an example.

A plan file is a JavaScript file that produces a [YSON ΛSON] object containing [Product product] definitions.
Prebake combines the products from all the plan files to produce a [PlanGraph] which is used to figure out how to build specific rules.

== Environment ==
All plan files are executed in an [PlanFileEnv environment] that includes [CommonJsEnv common] definitions and a `tools` object that contains a method for each available [ToolFile tool].

== Return Conventions ==
The last statement in a plan file should produce a mapping of product names to product bodies.
The easiest way to do this is to just put a parenthesized [YSON ΛSON] object at the end of your plan file, e.g.
{{{
({
  productName1: { actions: [tools.myTool(...)] },
  productName2: { actions: ... },
  productName3: ...
})
}}}
