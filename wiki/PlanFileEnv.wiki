#summary JavaScript environment available to plan files.

[PlanFile Plan files] execute in an environment where [ToolFile tools]
are exposed as methods of the `tools` object.

They run as if the following code ran before them:
{{{
var tools = {
  gcc: function (inputGlobs, outputGlobs, options) {

  },
  javac: function (inputGlobs, outputGlobs, options) {

  },
  ...
};
}}}

If a plan file wishes to `[CommonJsEnv load]` a JavaScript module and
wishes to provide the `tools` object to that module it must do so
explicitly.
