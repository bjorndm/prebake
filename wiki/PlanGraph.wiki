#summary graph of dependencies between products.

Prebake uses a graph of dependencies between products to figure out how to build targets.

If one [Product product's] outputs [Glob intersect] with another product's inputs, then the former product needs to be up-to-date before the latter can be built.  For example, if product `classes` has outputs `lib/**.class` and product `jars` has inputs `libs/**.class`, then `classes` has to be built before `jars`.  All product dependencies are inferred this way.  Unlike ANT and Make, there are no explicit dependency declarations between products.

The `graph` [PreBakeCommand command] dumps the plan graph to GraphViz format.
