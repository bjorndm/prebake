#summary commands between the service and client

= Commands =

The [PreBake prebake] client sends commands to the PreBakery over a [PrebakeDirectory named pipe].

Commands are strings of JSON and the structures below should fit into the [http://jsonml.org/ JSON ML] subset of JSON.

E.g. {{{ [ 'build', {}, [ 'target0', 'target1' ] ] }}} to request that the service kick off a build of targets {{{target0}}} and {{{target1}}}.

Each command has the form {{{ [}}}_verb_{{{, {"}}}_option_{{{": }}}_value_{{{ }, [ }}}_arguments_{{{ ] ]}}}.

== Verbs ==
|| *Verb* || *Options* || *Arguments* || *Effect* ||
|| build || N/A || targets || builds the given targets ||
|| plan || N/A || targets || prints the targets that would be built if targets were passed to build ||
|| changes || N/A || N/A || prints the set of files that have been changed since their dependencies were last built ||
|| graph || targets || N/A || prints, in [http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html DOT] format, a graph of the dependencies between the given targets and all targets that any of them indirectly depend upon. ||
|| shutdown || N/A || N/A || shuts down the PreBakery ||
