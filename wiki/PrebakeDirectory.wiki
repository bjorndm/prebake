= {{{.prebake}}} directory structure =

{{{
<client-root>/
    .prebake/
        pid
        hashes.bdb
        port
        cmdline
        token
}}}

The PreBakery service creates a directory in the ClientRoot on startup and, except for {{{cmdline}}}, deletes it on shutdown.

=== {{{<client-root>/.prebake/pid}}} ===

Contains the process id of the PreBakery service.

=== {{{<client-root>/.prebake/hashes.bdb}}} ===

Contains a [http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/index.html Berkeley DB] mapping file paths under [ClientRoot <client-root>] to MD5 hashes of those files.

=== {{{<client-root>/.prebake/port}}} ===

Contains a port number on the local machine.  The [PreBake bake] command connects to this port to kick off builds using the PreBakeCommand grammar.

=== {{{<client-root>/.prebake/cmdline}}} ===

Contains the {{{argv}}} passed to the prior PreBakery so the {{{bake}}} command can start a PreBakery if none is running.

=== {{{<client-root>/.prebake/token}}} ===

Contains a random string which the {{{bake}}} command sends with PreBakeCommand to demonstrate that it has at least a minimal level of access to the ClientRoot.
