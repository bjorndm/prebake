#summary usage for the client and service

= Usage =

== The prebakery Service ==
{{{
prebakery --root=<client-root-directory> [--ignore=<ignore-pattern>] [--umask=<umash>]  [--tools=<tools-path>] <bake-file> ...
}}}

will start up the bakery service.  It will write create a {{{.prebake}}} [PrebakeDirectory directory] if there is none already.

The {{{<client-root-directory>}}} is a directory containing all source files manipulable by the system.

The {{{<ignore-pattern>}}} is a regex of file paths to ignore, such as {{{/.*~$|/.*bak$|/\.svn/}}} to ignore files that end with "~" or ".bak" or all ".svn" directories and their contents.

The {{{<umask>}}} affects the permission bits on all files created as a result of executing build commands.

== The prebake command ==
{{{
prebake <target> ...
}}}

will connect to a {{{prebakery}}} by looking for a {{{.prebake}}} directory in an ancestorward traversal and run a build.  It will load the specified {{{<bake-file>}}}, a javascript source file run in the [BakefileEnv Bakefile environment].
It will then build the associated [Target targets].
